# SCA-Cloud-School-Application
A Webpage Application
This project was pretty simple, you need to add authentication and data validation and probably some JavaScript to make it more viable.
But with ASP.NET Core itâ€™s as simple as this project, and using code scaffolding and some templates it can be even easier and faster.
The important thing is that you grasped the basics, and with just a little more you can build many more complex pages. And .NET Core + Docker make this portable,
and compatible with many platforms, so yes all these tools are pretty useful.
